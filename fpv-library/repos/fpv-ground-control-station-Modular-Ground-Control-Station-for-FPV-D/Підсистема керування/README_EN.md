# Control Subsystem

The control subsystem provides two-way data exchange through the ground station's communication lines using the RS-485 standard between the operator's remote controller and the control transmitter installed in the ground station's remote unit.

The control subsystem includes:
- JR Module Adapter (on the remote controller side)
- TX Unit (on the remote unit side)

## Short Technical Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Note |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Control protocol | CRSF | Via S.Port |
| Transmission interface | Differential signal of RS-485 standard | Noise-resistant, long lines |
| Data transmission channel | Ground station communication lines | Maximum length depends on the cable type |
| Operating mode | Two-way | Control + telemetry |
| JR module adapter power supply | 5–8.4 V | From the remote controller |
| TX unit power supply | From the remote unit concentrator | Via XS2 |
| TX control transmitter module power supply | 8V | From the TX unit |
| TX unit output voltage via XS3 connector | 8V | Maximum long-term current 2A |
| Cooling | Passive | Radiators + ventilation holes |
| Shielding | Partial | |

## Operating Principle and Architecture

The control signal from the remote controller goes to the JR module adapter, where it is converted into a differential RS-485 signal. Then, the signal is transmitted through the ground station's communication lines to the TX unit, where reverse conversion into a CRSF protocol signal occurs before being fed to the control transmitter. The return channel (telemetry) works similarly in the opposite direction.
