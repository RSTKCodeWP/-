# OpenDrone Web: Claude instructions

## Commands
- `npm run dev -- --port <port>`: dev server. Ports 3001-3009 for agent worktrees; 3000 is Stan's.
- `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`: must pass before any PR merge.
  `npm test` runs the node:test suites in `app/**/*.test.ts` (no framework dep).
- `npm run build`: production build (runs `sync:legal` first).

## Writing rules
- **No em dashes anywhere**: not in docs, site copy, commit messages, or code
  comments. Use commas, colons, hyphens, or middots instead.
- Docs state settled facts only. Status, open questions, and task tracking live
  in exactly one file: `drafts/coordination.md`.

## Git flow: worktree per agent, PRs into protected `main`

`main` is protected: direct pushes are rejected; everything lands via
squash-merged PRs, and Oxygen auto-deploys `main` on merge. **Push after every
commit**; local-only commits never reach opendrone.be.

- **One agent = one worktree = one branch = one dev port.** Claim a lane first:
  `git worktree add ~/OpenDrone-Web-wt/<lane> -b feat/<lane> origin/main`, then
  work ONLY there (`npm ci` once). The main checkout `~/OpenDrone-Web` belongs
  to Stan and the oversight session; don't edit files there if `git status`
  shows work that isn't yours.
- **Check `drafts/coordination.md` before claiming files.** It is the live
  lane registry, file-ownership map, and task board. Update it when you claim,
  hand off, or finish a lane.
- **Hands off other lanes.** Never stash, clean, branch-switch over, or delete
  someone else's WIP; note blockers in coordination.md instead.
- **Commit small; PR early, merge fast**: `gh pr create` once the lane is
  coherent; `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` after typecheck + lint pass
  and the change is verified on your own port.
- **Never squash-merge a branch that redid work already on `main`**: it
  silently reverts main's newer version to the branch's older one.
- **After any merge, every live lane rebases** (`git fetch && git rebase
  origin/main`). Build only against origin/main, never against another lane's
  unmerged branch.
- **Lane done**: merge the PR, `git worktree remove ~/OpenDrone-Web-wt/<lane>`,
  delete the branch.
- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <your model name> <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Project docs: read before starting a lane
- `drafts/coordination.md`: live lane registry + task board. Always check first.
- `drafts/ui-overhaul-brief.md`: design rules, anti-patterns, library verdicts. Before UI work.
- `drafts/theming.md`: full light/dark token contract + gold/green rules. Before touching colors.
- `docs/store-compliance.md`: GPSR, withdrawal, VAT, sanctions, battery-free shipping.
  Before checkout, legal pages, product templates, or shipping/tax config.
- `docs/growth-architecture.md`: analytics/attribution/email/ledger facts + canonical UTM values.
- `drafts/drone-builder-scope.md`: 3D builder phase plan.
- `drafts/archive/`: frozen point-in-time documents. Reference only; never update them.

## Theming (summary)
Light + dark via CSS-custom-property token swap. Semantic tokens only, never
literal colors: dark values live in the Tailwind `@theme` block in
`app/styles/app.css`, light overrides under `html.light` right below. Text on
gold fills uses `--color-on-accent`. Theme init/toggle: `app/lib/theme.ts`.
Token list, gold/green ramps, embed caveats: `drafts/theming.md`.

## Skills
`frontend-design` before building new UI, `verify` before committing nontrivial
changes, `code-review`, `run`. The EDA/hardware skills don't apply to this repo.

## Gotchas
- Hydrogen pins react-router to **7.16.x**: close react-router Dependabot PRs,
  never merge them. Recheck the `vite.config.ts` xstate alias on Hydrogen upgrades.
- `PUBLIC_COMING_SOON` unset = shop locked (no prices, notify-only). Set `=0` in
  your worktree's `.env` to test unlocked flows; never deploy that to production.
- Turnstile never renders on localhost, and `SUPPORT_TURNSTILE_DEV_SKIP=1` is
  only honored when `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is unset. Comment out the secret
  locally to test notify/support forms.
