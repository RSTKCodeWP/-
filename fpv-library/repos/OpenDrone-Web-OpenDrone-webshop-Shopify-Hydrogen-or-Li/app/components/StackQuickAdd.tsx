 * board only (the BXGY's "get Y" side, today the OpenESC), never the pair.
 * Callers say which side that is: when the discounted board is the partner
 * being added, pass its derived discounted `price` plus the full price as
 * `compareAtPrice`; when it's the board the visitor is already buying, pass
 * its name as `discountedLabel` so the badge reads "OpenESC −10%".
