          Every board on this site tells you where it comes from, because the
          production files are public. This page is the same answer in prose:
          who designs it, who builds it today, and what we want to change
          about that.

            repos (KiCad projects, CERN-OHL-S license files, OSHWA UIDs

        <p>
          Every board is designed in-house in Leuven, Belgium, in KiCad. The
          full project (schematic, layout, BOM, 3D STEP) is public on GitHub
          under CERN-OHL-S v2 before you can buy the board, and the boards are
          OSHWA-certified (BE000026–BE000033). What we send to the factory and
          what you can download are the same files.
        </p>

        <h2 className="editorial-section-title">02 · Built at JLCPCB today</h2>
        {/* TODO(copy-stan): placeholder — no certifications or QC claims
            beyond what actually happens; adjust when the process changes. */}
        <p>
          Fabrication and assembly currently happen at JLCPCB in China, the
          same fab anyone can send the public Gerbers and BOM to. The BOM is
          written around parts you can actually order, so a self-build is a
          real option, not a theoretical one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finished boards come back to Belgium, where they are inspected,
          flashed and packed before shipping. Every board leaves with a build
          card naming its batch and the exact GitHub revision it was built
          from.

            No timelines, no named partners until something is signed. */}
        <p>
          We want assembly closer to home. The honest obstacle is cost:
          EU assembly today adds real money per board, and pretending
          otherwise helps nobody. So the plan is a proof-of-concept run:
          assemble a batch in the EU, publish what it actually cost, and let
          the numbers decide how fast we move.
        </p>
        <p>
          No timeline on this page, on purpose. When an EU-assembled batch
          exists, it will say so on the product page and here, with the cost
          breakdown, because that is the interesting part.
