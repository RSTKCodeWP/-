        <h2 className="editorial-section-title">01 · How the split works</h2>
        <p>
          When you buy a board, the checkout total covers the hardware price plus
          a €1 firmware contribution baked in. We batch those contributions and
          forward them to the upstream project via GitHub Sponsors,
          OpenCollective, or a direct bank transfer, depending on what the
          maintainers have set up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buy a stack (an OpenFC-Lite and an OpenESC in one order) and the
          split doubles: €1 to Betaflight, €1 to AM32. Every board carries its
          own contribution, so both maintainers keep their cut.
