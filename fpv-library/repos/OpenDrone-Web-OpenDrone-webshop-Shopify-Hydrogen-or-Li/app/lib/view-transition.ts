/**
 * Resilient wrapper around the View Transitions API.
 *
 * Two independent things start view transitions on this document:
 *   1. React Router (every <Link viewTransition>/<NavLink viewTransition> nav).
 *   2. The ThemeToggle's circular theme reveal (a manual startViewTransition).
 *
 * The browser only runs one transition at a time: starting a second one while
 * the first is live ABORTS the first. The aborted transition's `.ready` /
 * `.finished` / `.updateCallbackDone` promises then reject with
 * `InvalidStateError: Transition was aborted because of invalid state` (or an
 * `AbortError`). If those rejections aren't caught they flood the console, and
 * — worse — when the aborted one is a React Router *navigation* transition, its
 * state-commit render is interrupted, which can leave the next route (the PDP
 * board art) mounted but stuck pre-reveal until a refresh.
 *
 * This module:
 *   - tracks whether a transition is currently in flight,
 *   - refuses to start a *manual* transition while one is already running (it
 *     just applies the DOM update directly, so we never abort React Router's
 *     navigation transition out from under it), and
 *   - swallows AbortError/InvalidStateError on every promise it touches so a
 *     skipped/aborted transition can never surface as an unhandled rejection.
 *
 * React Router's own navigation transitions don't route through here, so we
 * also expose `markTransition()` for callers that hold a ViewTransition from
 * elsewhere and just want its rejections swallowed + the in-flight flag set.

 *
 * This is what lets a manual theme transition know a navigation transition is
 * already running (so it skips instead of aborting it, which is what produced
 * the half-rendered board), and it stops React Router's own transition from
 * ever surfacing `InvalidStateError` as an unhandled rejection when it gets
 * skipped/interrupted by a rapid second navigation.
