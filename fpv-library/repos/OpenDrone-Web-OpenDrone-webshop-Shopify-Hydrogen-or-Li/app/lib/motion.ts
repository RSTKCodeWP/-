 * existing CSS animation feel like one coherent system rather than two
 * libraries with different personalities.
 *
 * Keep motion calm and engineering-grade: short travel, no bounce/overshoot.
 * Reduced-motion is enforced globally by <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">
 * in PageLayout — individual components don't need to re-check it.
