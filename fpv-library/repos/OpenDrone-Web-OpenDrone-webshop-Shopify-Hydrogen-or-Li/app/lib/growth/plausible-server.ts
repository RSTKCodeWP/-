/**
 * Server-side Plausible events (Events API).
 *
 * The buyer finishes payment on Shopify's checkout domain, outside our
 * pages, so the funnel's final step cannot be a client event. The
 * orders/paid webhook posts a `Purchase` event with revenue straight to
 * the Plausible Events API instead (https://plausible.io/api/event, no
 * API key needed for event ingestion; the domain must simply be a site
 * registered on the account).
 *
 * Caveats, accepted by design:
 * - Every server event carries the same synthetic User-Agent and no
 *   client IP, so Plausible attributes them all to one "visitor" and no
 *   session/funnel join to the buyer's browsing exists. Event counts,
 *   revenue totals, and the source/campaign prop breakdowns are what
 *   this is for; visitor counts on this event are meaningless.
 * - Channel comes from the order's `_utm_*` note_attributes (first-touch
 *   attribution promoted through cart attributes), not from a referrer.
 * - Dedupe is the caller's job: the webhook route sends only on the
 *   orders/paid topic, claims `pev:<order_id>` atomically (SETNX) before
 *   sending, and stamps `purchaseEventAt` on the ledger order record, so
 *   redeliveries and the orders/create + orders/paid pair do not
 *   double-count revenue.
 *
 * Degrade-soft like everything else in growth/: never throws, returns
 * false on any failure, and callers run it inside waitUntil so the
 * webhook 200 is never blocked.
