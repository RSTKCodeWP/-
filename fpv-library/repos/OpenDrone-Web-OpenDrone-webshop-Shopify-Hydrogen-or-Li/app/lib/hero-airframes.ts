/**
 * DERIVED views for the homepage hero's airframe sizes + board stack.
 *
 * The truth now lives in the builder parts registry
 * (`app/lib/builder/registry.ts` — AIRFRAMES / SLOTS / PART_CATALOG /
 * HERO_DEFAULT_BUILDS); this module only reshapes it into the exact exports
 * the hero has always consumed, so every existing consumer (routes/_index,
 * HeroScene, HeroSizeSlider) keeps compiling and behaving unchanged.
 *
 * Adding a drone size is STILL config-only — add an AirframeDef + the per-size
 * PartDefs/GLBs + HERO_DEFAULT_BUILDS entry in the registry, and the matching
 * `Model` variants on the FC/ESC products. Nothing else hardcodes the size
 * list. (See the registry header for the full checklist.)
 *
 * NOTE: the slider's 1:1 drag-scrub (and the 3D cross-slide it feeds) is tuned
 * for two positions. A 3rd size renders fine as a third click-to-select option
 * and swaps correctly; only the drag gesture would need a segmented rework.

 * broken slot keeps its last-known-good shape with an empty handle, and the
 * hero card falls back to the base product link.
