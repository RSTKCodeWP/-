# Shopify setup state - store ktjqug-jw / opendrone.be

Updated: 2026-07-02 after read-only recon (agent browsed full admin). One browser-agent task at a
time; update this file after every run. **STAN** = needs Stan personally.

## Task queue

- [x] 0. Recon audit - done 2026-07-02, findings below
- [x] 1. DONE 2026-07-02 (verified): OpenStack category → "Circuit Boards & Components in Electronics"; Legal notice now states KBO 1038.934.039 / VAT BE 1038.934.039 (rest of text untouched). Side notes: OpenStack metafield count dropped 4→3 with the category swap (check nothing important vanished); OpenFC Lite's own category is "Microcontroller Starter Kits in Computer Starter Kits" - consider aligning to Circuit Boards & Components in a later pass.
- [x] 2. Prices - RESOLVED 2026-07-02: all placeholders, Stan updates them in Shopify himself later. Verified the site hardcodes no prices (all from Storefront API), so nothing to sync code-side.
- [x] 3. DONE 2026-07-02: archived "OpenFC" product deleted (3 markers verified pre-delete); automatic discount "OpenStack - FC + ESC stack discount" live (buy 1 OpenFC Lite any variant → 1 OpenESC any variant 10% off, can't combine, no end date). Code side shipped in PR #246 (openfc entry + board art removed).
- [ ] 3b. OpenStack retirement - code SHIPPED (PR #250 merged + deployed 2026-07-02): stack builder live on FC/ESC buy modules (partner picker ready for future OpenFC Pro), /products/openstack 301s to the FC page, nav/home/cart references gone. REMAINING: archive the OpenStack product in Shopify admin (safe now that the redirect is deployed) - next agent run.
- [ ] 3c. Donation upsell - code SHIPPED (PR #250): cart page AND cart drawer render DonationUpsell once the `firmware-donation` product exists (agent creating it: 4 variants €1/3/5/10, no shipping, no inventory, type Donation). Bookkeeping note for accountant: decide VAT treatment of the donation line (currently created tax-unchecked).
- [ ] 4. Product descriptions + SEO + alt text ← Stan's copy walkthrough (in progress in terminal)
- [x] 5. Collections exclusion - INVESTIGATED 2026-07-02: Storefront API returns 0 collections, but harmless - all internal links go to /collections/all which queries products directly (products API returns all 9 active). Optional later: publish collections to the Hydrogen channel if real category pages are ever wanted.
- [ ] 6. Taxes: add **Belgian VAT registration** (OSS explicitly can't cover BE - in-app warning); toggle company VAT number on; enable VAT invoices
- [ ] 7. Shipping - DECIDED 2026-07-02: worldwide at launch. Notion task created for Iebe (rates/zones via Sendcloud, real weights incl. battery strap 0.0 kg, HS codes + origin, DDU/DDP, export-compliance country exclusions, policy page update): https://app.notion.com/p/391fe06764e181e49526d6b486f83299
- [ ] 8. Notifications: sender stan.coene@gmail.com UNVERIFIED (customers see generic @shopifyemail.com) → switch to contact@opendrone.be + verify domain; retarget notification URLs from legacy Online Store to opendrone.be Hydrogen channel
- [ ] 9. Domains: opendrone.be = primary on Hydrogen channel ✓ (Notion task stale - mostly done). But www.opendrone.be points at the LEGACY password-protected Online Store → redirect www → apex/Hydrogen
- [ ] 10. Legal/policy pages final text (2-yr guarantee, GPSR, withdrawal form, Consumentenombudsdienst not ODR); privacy policy is "Automated" (generic) → vault version with processor table
- [ ] 11. **STAN**: Activate payment provider - NONE active (Shopify Payments "Set up", PayPal not activated). #1 blocker. BV verification + bank account.
- [ ] 12. **Iebe**: InvenTree custom app token ("OpenDrone Infra" custom app already installed) + sync plugin
- [ ] 13. **STAN**: End-to-end test order → then remove legacy-store password (currently ON, pw "askohg")
