# Storefront compliance requirements (opendrone.be)

Reference for anyone building or reviewing the store. It lists the EU and Belgian requirements the storefront itself must satisfy: product-listing content, consumer-law machinery, privacy/cookies, tax display, shipping policy, and sales restrictions. Incutec BV is an EU-established manufacturer selling B2C and B2B and shipping from Belgium, so the store carries the manufacturer and seller obligations directly.

This is the storefront-facing subset. Product certification (CE/RED/FCC) and internal operational planning live elsewhere and are out of scope here.

## 1. Product-listing content (GPSR, Reg (EU) 2023/988)

Every product listing must show, before purchase:
- Manufacturer identity: Incutec BV, plus a postal address and an electronic (email) contact.
- Product identifiers: type, and batch or serial reference where applicable.
- At least one product image.
- Any safety warnings and safety information, in the language of the target market (NL and FR for Belgium; add DE for the German market).

Build these as required fields in the product template so a listing cannot publish without them.

## 2. Consumer distance-selling (Belgian WER Boek VI, CRD 2011/83, guarantee 2019/771)

- **14-day right of withdrawal** from delivery, no reason required. Provide the model withdrawal form.
- **Withdrawal button.** A one-click "withdraw from contract" control on the online interface is legally required (in force since 19 June 2026). It must be available throughout the withdrawal period, lead to a confirmation page, and produce a durable-medium acknowledgment.
- **Withdrawal exceptions are narrow.** A standard catalogue kit is NOT exempt just because it is assembled or soldered; it is only exempt if built to an individual customer's specification. Opened electronics can still be returned; the customer is liable only for diminished value beyond what is needed to establish the product's nature and functioning. State this in the return policy rather than refusing returns.
- **2-year legal conformity guarantee.** Belgium applies the full 2-year reversal of the burden of proof. This is separate from any commercial warranty and cannot be contracted away for consumers. Include the digital-elements/firmware-update conformity clause.
- **Mandatory pre-contract information** on the offer and at checkout: trader identity plus geographic and electronic address, total price including taxes and all shipping/handling, payment and delivery arrangements, the withdrawal right plus model form, the legal guarantee, and complaint handling.
- Do not link the EU ODR platform (discontinued 20 July 2025). Point consumers to the Belgian Consumentenombudsdienst instead.
- Provide at least two substantially different delivery methods (Art. VI.45/2 WER).

### Required legal pages
Terms and conditions, privacy policy, cookie policy, return/refund policy, and the withdrawal form. Replace any auto-generated storefront defaults with the reviewed Incutec versions.

## 3. Privacy and cookies (GDPR, Belgian DPA/GBA)

- Privacy policy stating legal bases: order fulfilment and shipping = contract; newsletter = consent (double opt-in).
- Keep data-processing agreements with the storefront platform, payment provider, email tool, and analytics.
- **Cookie consent must meet the strict Belgian standard:** a reject-all button on the first layer with equal prominence to accept-all; no cookie walls; analytics/measurement cookies require consent (no legitimate-interest shortcut); granular per-purpose consent; easy withdrawal. Prefer a consent-mode CMP, or a cookieless analytics option to reduce surface.
- Electronic marketing to consumers is opt-in.

## 4. VAT and pricing

- Display prices to consumers inclusive of tax.
- Charge Belgian VAT (21%) on EU consumer sales until the EU-wide distance-sales threshold is crossed, then destination-country VAT under the Union One-Stop-Shop. Wire the tax engine so it flips to destination rates at the threshold.
- B2B intra-EU: support reverse charge with VAT-number capture and VIES validation (zero-rated intra-community supply).
- Non-EU orders: exports are VAT zero-rated; the customer pays local import VAT and duty. State the incoterm at checkout (DAP by default, or DDP if Incutec pre-pays duties) so there are no surprise-charge disputes.

## 5. Sales restrictions (sanctions and export)

- Block shipping destinations under EU sanctions at checkout: Russia, Belarus, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, and Crimea/occupied territories. Keep the blocked-country list maintainable.
- Screen orders against EU restricted-party lists.
- For B2B orders to buyers outside the EU (excluding close-partner countries), the contract terms must carry the mandatory "no re-export to Russia" clause and, above the review threshold, capture an end-use statement.
- Publish the civilian-only end-use policy and reference it in the terms.

## 6. Shipping policy

- **No loose lithium batteries.** Kits ship battery-free; the listing points the customer to a compatible battery. Loose LiPo packs are dangerous goods that the ordinary parcel stream will not carry, so they are out of scope for the store.
- Non-battery items (boards, chargers without cells, accessories) ship normally.
- Offer the two required delivery methods and show carrier, cost, and delivery time before checkout.

## 7. Product conformity display

Publish the signed Declarations of Conformity and show the CE marking on the relevant product pages (open, RadioMaster-style publishing). Link the DoC PDF from each certified SKU's listing.
